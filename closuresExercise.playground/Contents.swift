/*
 You want to pass around the unlocking treasure chest instructions in your codebase. To extend this functionality, you will abstract the instructions into a closure.

 A closure allows you to save instructions to a variable/constant. You will use a constant instead of a variable because you only need to assign the closure once in this exercise.

 With the functionality contained in a constant, you can pass around the constant like any other constant. In addition to executing blocks of code, you can save a closure in a variable/constant. Thus, making a closure more versatile than a function. Saving a closure inside a variable/constant is an example showcase of its versatility.

 You will practice writing a closure to unlock a treasure chest in this exercise.
